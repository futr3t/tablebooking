## Testing

A test file `test-mobile.html` has been created to test the widget on different mobile device sizes. This includes a device simulator that can switch between common mobile viewport widths.

## Browser Compatibility

The responsive improvements are compatible with:
- iOS Safari 12+
- Chrome for Android 80+
- Samsung Internet 10+

## Next Steps

To fully deploy these changes:
